## A Simple Peer To Peer Network Implementation


This project aims to implement a P2P network with the specific properties below:

* There is a Root node which acts as a DNS Server.
* Nodes connect together through messages they sent.
* User-to-network connection is done through a user interface.

To test this network, you need to be able to run both in the role (server DNS (root) and in the role of the client, and see the role and way of rejecting messages and various operations performed on the network).

### What is a P2P network

Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application. They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes.
